# üê≥ `stencila/maker`

**A Docker image for making the Stencila command line tool**

## Purpose

This image builds the `stencila` command line tool within containers so that the binary can be copied to other containers using the same base image (e.g. `ubuntu:focal`) without bloating them with build dependencies while maintaining version compatibility with shared libraries such as `libc` and `libssl`.

This image should not be confused with the [`stencila/builder`](../builder/) (which is part of the Stencila's Cloud Native Buildpack distribution).

## Usage

Build this image, e.g.

```sh
docker build --tag stencila/maker:focal maker/focal
```

This defaults to building the current `HEAD` of the repository but you can use the Docker build argument `STENCILA_VERSION` to build a tag, branch or commit id.

Then, in another image copy the `stencila` binary from the `/stencila/target/release/` folder of the `maker` image,

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=stencila/maker:focal /stencila/target/release/stencila /usr/local/bin/
```
