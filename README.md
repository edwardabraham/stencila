# Stencila

Welcome to the main entry point to the Stencila ecosystem. This repo contains the `stencila` command line tool which is the top level 'umbrella' package to use our various libraries.

> :sparkles: We are undergoing a major reboot in this repository (and many of our others) to build a single entry point for reproducible documents. We will deprecate `stencila/cli` and `stencila/desktop` and instead build those binaries here. We will also be deprecating binary builds of our other repositories as they are integrated into this one.
