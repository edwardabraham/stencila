This is `v2` of Stencila, a rewrite in Rust aimed at leveraging two relatively recent and impactful innovations:

- [Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)](https://crdt.tech/), and specifically the production ready, Rust-based [Automerge `v2`](https://github.com/automerge/automerge), for de-centralized collaboration and version control.

- [Generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer), and large language models (LLMs) in general, for boosting authoring and coding productivity.

We're in the early stages of this rewrite, and this readme will be updated with a roadmap and other details soon.
