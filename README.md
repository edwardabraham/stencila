## üëã Introduction

Stencila is a platform for collaborating on, and publishing, dynamic, data-driven content. Our aim is to lower the barriers for creating programmable documents and make it easier to create beautiful, interactive, and semantically rich, articles, web pages and applications from them.

## üìà Status

This is `v2` of Stencila, a rewrite in Rust aimed at leveraging two relatively recent and impactful innovations:

- [Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)](https://crdt.tech/), and specifically the production ready, Rust-based [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge), for de-centralized collaboration and version control.

- [Large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) for assisting in writing and editing, prose and code.

We are embarking on a rewrite because CRDTs will now be the foundational synchronization and storage layer for Stencila documents. This requires fundamental changes to most other parts of the platform (e.g. how changes are applied to dynamic documents). Furthermore, a rewrite allow us to bake in, rather than bolt on, mechanisms to mitigate the risks associated with using LLM assistants for authoring documents (e.g. recording the actor, human or LLM, that made the change to a document).

Having said that, much of the code in the [`v1` branch](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/v1) will be reused (probably after some tidy-ups and refactoring), so `v2` is not a _complete_ rewrite.

## üì• Install

Although `v2` is in early stages of development, and functionality may be limited or buggy, we are taking a "release early, release often" approach and releasing binary builds of alpha versions of the Stencila CLI tool and language packages. Doing so allows us to get early feedback and monitor what impact the addition of features has on build times and distribution sizes.

### CLI tool

#### Windows

To install the latest release download `stencila-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/latest) and place it somewhere on your `PATH`.

#### MacOS

To install the latest release in `/usr/local/bin`,

```console
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stencila/stencila/main/install.sh | bash
```

To install a specific version, append `-s vX.X.X`. Or, if you'd prefer to do it manually, download `stencila-<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz` from the one of the [releases](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases) and then,

```console
tar xvf stencila-*.tar.xz
sudo mv -f stencila /usr/local/bin # or wherever you prefer
```

#### Linux

To install the latest release in `~/.local/bin/`,

```console
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stencila/stencila/main/install.sh | bash
```

To install a specific version, append `-s vX.X.X`. Or, if you'd prefer to do it manually, download `stencila-<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz` from the one of the [releases](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases) and then,

```console
tar xvf stencila-*.tar.xz
mv -f stencila ~/.local/bin/ # or wherever you prefer
```

#### Docker

The CLI is also available in a Docker image you can pull from the Github Container Registry,

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/stencila/stencila
```

and use locally like this for example,

```console
docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work --network host ghcr.io/stencila/stencila --help
```

## ‚ö° Usage

See `stencila --help` or the reference documentation for the CLI [here](docs/reference/cli.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Develop

This repository is organized into the following modules. Please see their respective READMEs for guides to contributing.

- [`schema`](schema): YAML files which define the Stencila Schema, an implementation of, and extensions to, [schema.org](https://schema.org), for programmable documents.

- `json-ld` [`üß≠ Planned`]: A [JSON LD](https://json-ld.org/) `@context`, generated from Stencila Schema, which can be used to transform Stencila documents to other vocabularies.

- `json-schema` [`üß≠ Planned`]: A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), generated from Stencila Schema, which can be used to validate Stencila documents.

- [`rust`](rust): Several Rust crates implementing core functionality and a CLI for working with Stencila documents.

- `python` [`üß≠ Planned`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/issues/1624): A Python package, with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) classes generated from Stencila Schema and bindings to Rust functions, so you can work with Stencila documents from within Python.

- `typescript` [`üß≠ Planned`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/issues/1625): A package of TypeScript types generated from Stencila Schema so you can create type-safe Stencila documents in the browser, Node.js, Deno etc.

- `node` [`üß≠ Planned`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/issues/1626): A Node.js package, using the generated TypeScript types and with runtime validation and bindings to Rust functions, so you can work with Stencila documents from within Node.js.

- [`docs`](docs) `üèóÔ∏è In progress`: Documentation, including reference documentation generated from `schema` and the `rust` CLI tool.

- [`examples`](examples) `üèóÔ∏è In progress`: Example of documents conforming to Stencila Schema.
