# Stencila Types

**TypeScript types for the Stencila Schema**

## 👋 Introduction

This is the `@stencila/types` NPM package which provides TypeScript types for types in the [Stencila Schema](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/main/schema#readme).

## 📦 Install

```console
npm i @stencila/types
```

## 🛠️ Develop

Most of the types are generated from the Stencila Schema by the Rust [`schema-gen`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/main/rust/schema-gen#readme) crate. See there for contributing instructions.
