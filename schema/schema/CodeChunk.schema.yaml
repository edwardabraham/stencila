      `Never`: Never automatically execute the code chunk. Only execute when the user explicitly runs
      the code (or its containing document).
      `Needed`: Automatically execute the code chunk if needed. Execute the code chunk if it is an 
      upstream dependency of a node that has been executed, or is a downstream dependent of a node that
      has been executed.
      `Always`: Always execute the code, even if it, or its dependencies, are unchanged since the 
      last time it was executed.
