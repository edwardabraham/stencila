description: Union type for all primitives values
$comment: |
  The entity types in this union are automatically inserted during the build.
  The order of these types is important because it determines the
  order of attempted coercion (ie. parsing and reshaping to arrays).
anyOf:
  - $ref: 'Null'
  - $ref: Boolean
  - $ref: Integer
  - $ref: Number
  - $ref: String
