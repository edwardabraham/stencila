      Note that this excludes `CodeExpression` nodes since they should not have side effects
      (e.g. assigning variables) that would cause another node to be dependent upon them.
  codeDependents:
    '@id': stencila:codeDependents
    description: The downstream dependents.
    type: array
    items:
      anyOf:

      Note that in comparison to `codeDependencies`, this property does not allow for `Parameter`
      dependents (because parameters are never dependent upon others).
  compileDigest:
    '@id': stencila:compileDigest
    description: A digest of the content, semantics and dependencies of the node.
    type: string
  executeCount:
    '@id': stencila:executeCount
    description: A count of the number of times that the node has been executed.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0

      Intended to increment with each successive execution of the node, including across sessions.
      Note that this differs to the `execution_count` in Jupyter Notebook format which is
      the "code cell's prompt number" and which resets at the start of each new session.
  executeDigest:
    '@id': stencila:executeDigest
    description: The `compileDigest` of the node when it was last executed.
    type: string
  executeRequired:
    '@id': stencila:executeRequired
    description: Whether, and why, the code requires execution or re-execution.

  executeKernel:
    '@id': stencila:executeKernel
    description: The id of the kernel that the node was last executed in.
    type: string

    description: Status of the most recent, including any current, execution.

    '@id': stencila:executeEnded
    description: The date-time that the last execution ended.
