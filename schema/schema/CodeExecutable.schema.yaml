description: Base type for executable code nodes (i.e. `CodeChunk` and `CodeExpression`).
$comment: |
  Adds properties to the base `Code` node type that are necessary, or useful, for executable code.
  Also makes the `programmingLanguage` property required since that is necessary to be able to execute it.
properties:
  codeDependencies:
    '@id': stencila:codeDependencies
    description: The upstream dependencies of the code.
    type: array
    items:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: CodeChunk
        - $ref: File
        - $ref: Parameter
    $comment: |
      Note that this excludes `CodeExpression` nodes since they should not have side effects
      (e.g. assigning variables) that would cause another node to be dependent upon them.
  codeDependents:
    '@id': stencila:codeDependents
    description: The downstream dependents of the code.
    type: array
    items:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: Call
        - $ref: CodeChunk
        - $ref: CodeExpression
        - $ref: File

      Note that in comparison to `codeDependencies`, this property does not allow for `Parameter`
      dependents (because parameters are never dependent upon others).
  compileDigest:
    '@id': stencila:compileDigest
    description: A digest of the content, semantics and dependencies of the node.
    type: string
  executeCount:
    '@id': stencila:executeCount
    description: A count of the number of times that the node has been executed.
    type: integer
    minimum: 0

      Intended to increment with each successive execution of the node, including across sessions.
      Note that this differs to the `execution_count` in Jupyter Notebook format which is
      the "code cell's prompt number" and which resets at the start of each new session.
  executeDigest:
    '@id': stencila:executeDigest
    description: The `compileDigest` of the node when it was last executed.
    type: string
  executeRequired:
    '@id': stencila:executeRequired
    description: Whether, and why, the code requires execution or re-execution.
    $ref: ExecuteRequired
  executeStatus:
    '@id': stencila:executeStatus
    description: Status of the most recent, including any current, execution of the code.
    $ref: ExecuteStatus
  executeEnded:
    '@id': stencila:executeEnded
    description: The date-time that the the last execution of the code ended.
    $ref: Date
  executeDuration:
    '@id': stencila:executeDuration
    description: Duration in seconds of the last execution of the code.
    type: number
    minimum: 0
  executeAuto:
    '@id': stencila:executeAuto
    description: Under which circumstances the code should be automatically executed.
    $ref: ExecuteAuto
  errors:
    '@id': stencila:errors
    description: Errors when compiling (e.g. syntax errors) or executing the chunk.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: CodeError
