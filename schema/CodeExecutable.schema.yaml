description: Base type for executable code nodes (i.e. `CodeChunk` and `CodeExpression`).
$comment: |
  Adds properties to the base `Code` node type that are necessary, or useful, for executable code.
  Also makes the `programmingLanguage` property required since that is necessary to be able to execute it.
properties:
  compileDigest:
    '@id': stencila:compileDigest
    description: The SHA-256 digest of the `text`, `programmingLanguage` and `mediaType` properties the last time the node was compiled.
    type: string

      Used to determine whether it is necessary to re-compile the node (i.e. to semantically analyse it
      for dependencies).
  executeDigest:
    '@id': stencila:executeDigest
    description: The SHA-256 digest of `compileDigest` and the `executeDigest`s of all dependencies, the last time the node was executed.
    type: string

      Used to determine whether it is necessary to re-execute the code.
