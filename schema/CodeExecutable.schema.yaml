description: Base type for executable code nodes (i.e. `CodeChunk` and `CodeExpression`).
$comment: |
  Adds properties to the base `Code` node type that are necessary, or useful, for executable code.
  Also makes the `programmingLanguage` property required since that is necessary to be able to execute it.
properties:
  compileDigest:
    '@id': stencila:compileDigest
    description: A digest of the content, semantics and dependencies of the node.
    type: string
  executeDigest:
    '@id': stencila:executeDigest
    description: The `compileDigest` of the node when it was last executed.
    type: string
  executeStatus:
    '@id': stencila:executeStatus
    description: Status of the last execution of the code.
    enum:
      - Scheduled

      - Succeeded
      - Failed

    $ref: Date
  executeDuration:
    '@id': stencila:executeDuration
    description: Duration in seconds of the last execution of the code.
    type: number
    minimum: 0
  errors:
    '@id': stencila:errors
    description: Errors when compiling (e.g. syntax errors) or executing the chunk.
