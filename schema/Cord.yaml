description: A value comprised of a sequence of characters
category: data
$comment: |
  This type exists to differentiate between between a plain string of characters
  (which is modified by complete replacement) and a sequence of characters stored and
  synchronized as a CRDT (which is is modified by insertions and deletions).
  
  Its use includes the `value` property of the `Text` type and the `code`
  property of `CodeExecutable` nodes.
