description: Union type for all primitives values.
$comment: |
  Analogous to JSON values but adds `Integer` and `UnsignedInteger`.
  
  Similar to https://schema.org/DataType "The basic data types such as Integers, Strings, etc."
  but includes `Array` and `Object` and excludes `Date`, `Time` and `DateTime` (which are
  treated in this schema as `Entity`s having a `type` property to disambiguate them from strings).
default: 'Null'
anyOf:
  - $ref: 'Null'
  - $ref: Boolean
  - $ref: Integer
  - $ref: UnsignedInteger
  - $ref: Number
  - $ref: String
  - $ref: Array
  - $ref: Object
