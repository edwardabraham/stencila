  This is an implementation of schema.org [`Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization).

  An `Organization` node is analogous, and structurally similar to:
  - Crossref Organization element [`<crossref:organization>`](https://data.crossref.org/reports/help/schema_doc/4.4.0/relations_xsd.html#http___www.crossref.org_relations.xsd_organization)
  - JATS XML [`<institution-wrap>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/element/institution-wrap.html)
  - Open Document [`<text:organizations>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1419060_253892949) and [`<text:institutions>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1418948_253892949)
