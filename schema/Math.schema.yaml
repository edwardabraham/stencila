  This is a base type for `MathFragment` and `MathBlock` and should not
  normally be instantiated.
  This type has a similar structure and purpose to `Code` which is a base type
  for `CodeFragment`, `CodeBlock` etc.

  errors:
    '@id': stencila:errors
    description: Errors that occurred when parsing the math equation.

      This property is an array of strings. Compare this to `CodeChunk.errors`
      which is an array of `CodeError` nodes. Strings are considered to
      be sufficient for math parsing errors which usually won't have stack traces,
      line numbers etc.
