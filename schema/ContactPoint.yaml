description: A contact point, usually within an organization.
$comment:
  This is an implementation of schema.org [`ContactPoint`](https://schema.org/ContactPoint).
  It extends schema.org `ContactPoint` by, adding a `content` property which must be
  an array of [`Block`](./Block), as well as the properties added by
  [`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork) which it extends.

  `ContactPoint` is analogous, and structurally similar to, the JATS XML
  [`<corresp>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/element/corresp.html) element
  and the HTML5 [`<address>`](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#the-address-element) element.
