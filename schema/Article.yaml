  This is an implementation, and extension, of schema.org [`Article`](https://schema.org/Article).
  It extends schema.org `Article` by adding a `content` property which must be
  an array of [`Block`](./Block), as well as the properties added by
  [`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork) which it extends.

  An `Article` is analogous, and structurally similar to, the JATS XML
  [`<article>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.2/element/article.html)
  element.
