  Definition of a compute session, including its software and compute resource
  requirements and status.
$comment: |
  Usually used to define the environment that is required to execute an
  executable document.

  This is "inspired" by the [OCI Runtime Config Schema](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/schema/config-schema.json)
  There are a number of properties that did not seem relevant to our use as well as some
  references that did not seem to be required. We try to stay consistent with the naming
  used but have dereferenced and combined the config schema and 
  [Linux Schema](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/schema/defs-linux.json) 
  to use the cpu and memory limits.
