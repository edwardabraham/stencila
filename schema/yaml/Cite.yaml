description: A reference to a CreativeWork that is cited in another CreativeWork.
$comment: |
  A `Cite` node is used within a [`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork), usually an
  [`Article`](./Article), to refer to an other `CreativeWork`.
  Often a `Cite` will be associated with other citations, in a [`CiteGroup`](./CiteGroup).
properties:
  citationMode:
    '@id': stencila:citationMode
    description: Determines how the citation is shown within the surrounding text.
    type: string
    enum:
      - Parenthetical
      - Narrative
      - NarrativeAuthor
      - NarrativeYear
      # Deprecated mode names: retained for backwards compatibility
      # TODO: Remove in v2
      - normal # == parenthetical
      - suppressAuthor # == narrative-year
    default: parenthetical

      There are two main citation modes: parenthetical and narrative (a.k.a textual).
      See https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/parenthetical-versus-narrative
      for an explanation.

      This property is optional and tools are recommended to assume `parenthetical` if missing.

      Narrative citations will usually be of form "As noted by Smith (1992)," but `narrative-author`
      allows for "In the early nineties, Smith noted" and `narrative-year` allows for "As noted by Smith in 1992 and 1993".

      Pandoc's `CitationMode` enumeration has `Normal` (for `parenthetical`), `AuthorInText` (for `textual`),
      and `SuppressAuthor` (for `textual-year`).
      See https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/blob/0158cd0e2a2ca9d6f14389a1a57bc64cab45a7dd/src/Text/Pandoc/Definition.hs#L353.

      LaTeX's `natbib` package has `\citep{}` (for `parenthetical`), `\citet{}` (for `textual`),
      `\citeauthor{}` (for `textual-author`), `\citeyear{}` (for `textual-year`).
      See https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_citation_styles.

      Previously this was name `prefix` but for consistency with `citationMode`
      and `honorificPrefix`, to avoid ambiguity with other prefixes was renamed
      to `citationPrefix`.
