  This is a base type for `MathFragment` and `MathBlock` and should not
  normally be instantiated.
  This type has a similar structure and purpose to `CodeStatic` which is a base type
  for `CodeFragment`, `CodeBlock` etc.
required:
  - mathLanguage
  - code
core:
  - compileDigest
  - errors
  - mathml
properties:
  mathLanguage:
    '@id': stencila:mathLanguage
    description: The language used for the equation e.g tex, mathml, asciimath.
    type: string
  code:
    '@id': stencila:code
    description: The code of the equation in the `mathLanguage`.
    type: string
  compileDigest:
    '@id': stencila:compileDigest
    description: A digest of the `code` and `mathLanguage`.
    $comment: Used to avoid unnecessary transpilation to MathML.

  errors:
    '@id': stencila:errors
    description: Errors that occurred when parsing the math equation.

      This property is an array of strings. Compare this to `CodeChunk.errors`
      which is an array of `CodeError` nodes. Strings are considered to
      be sufficient for math parsing errors which usually won't have stack traces,
      line numbers etc.

    $comment: Used along with `compileDigest` to avoid unnecessary transpilation to MathML.
