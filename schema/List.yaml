  This is an implementation, and renaming, of schema.org [`ItemList`](https://schema.org/ItemList).
  Renaming was done as `List` was considered a more developer friendly alternative. Similarly,
  schema.org properties `itemListElement` and `itemListOrder` were renamed to `items` and `order`.
  Note that, as with every other such renaming in Stencila Schema, a mapping between names is
  defined and it is trivial to save Stencila Schema documents using the schema.org vocabulary if so desired.
