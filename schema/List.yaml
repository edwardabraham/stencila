  This is an implementation, and renaming, of schema.org [`ItemList`](https://schema.org/ItemList).
  Renaming was done as `List` was considered a more developer friendly alternative. Similarly,
  schema.org properties `itemListElement` and `itemListOrder` were renamed to `items` and `order`.
  Note that, as with every other such renaming in Stencila Schema, a mapping between names is
  defined and it is trivial to save Stencila Schema documents using the schema.org vocabulary if so desired.

  Analogues of `List` in other schema include:
    - JATS XML [`<list>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/tag-library/1.2/element/list.html)
    - HTML [`<ul>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) and [`<ol>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)
    - MDAST [`List`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#list)
    - OpenDocument [`<text:list>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1415148_253892949)
