  Adds properties to the base `Executable` node type that are necessary for executable code.
  The added properties are the same as for static code nodes. Both `code` and `programmingLanguage` are required.
required:
  - code
  - programmingLanguage
core:
  - guessLanguage
properties:

  programmingLanguage:
    '@id': schema:programmingLanguage
    description: The programming language of the code.
