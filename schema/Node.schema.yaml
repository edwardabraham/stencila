  The order of these types is important because it determines the
  order of attempted coercion (ie. parsing and reshaping to arrays)
anyOf:
  - $ref: Entity
  - type: 'null'
  - type: boolean
  - type: integer
  - type: number
  - type: string
  - type: object
  # Array should come last to avoid single items (e.g. a single string)
  # being coerced into an array.
  - type: array
