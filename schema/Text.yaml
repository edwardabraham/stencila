  Intended mostly for use for inline text e.g. the text in a paragraph.
  
  Differs from the primitive `String` type in that it has a `type` and `id` property.
  The `id` property allows use to identify text nodes with a sequence of inline nodes
  for better diffing.
  
  Also, in Rust, the `value` property is implemented as a CRDT.
required:
  - value
properties:

    '@id': 'schema:value'
