This is a relatively simple test article written in R Markdown. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Code chunks

A basic code chunk has the language code surrounded by curly braces e.g.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Chunks can also have a label and options e.g.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

### Using fig.cap option

The `fig.cap` option can be used to set the code chunk caption,

```{r fig1, fig.width=8, fig.cap='A plot'}
plot(data)
```

```{r table2, fig.cap='A table'}
head(data)
```

Bookdown-style `fig.cap` "text references" are also supported,

```{r figure3, fig.cap='(ref:fig3)'}
# R code here
```

(ref:fig3) A caption for figure 3.

Some intermediary content

```{r figure4, fig.cap='(ref:figure-4)'}
# R code here but non-existent figure reference
```

And follow up with a duplicate figure reference

```{r fig5, fig.cap='(ref:fig3)'}
# R code here
```

(ref:fig3) **Distinct and dorsoventrally organized properties of layer 2 stellate cells.**(**A**) Representative action potential after hyperpolarization waveforms from a SC (left), a pyramidal cell (middle) and an unidentified cell (right). The pyramidal and unidentified cells were...

## Code expressions

In R Markdown code expressions are represented using back ticks prefixed with the language e.g. `r 1+2`.
