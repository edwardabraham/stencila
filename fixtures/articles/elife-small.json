From an evolutionary perspective, however, this is shortsighted: if efforts to reduce caterpillar populations fail, planthoppers will continue using the caterpillars as camouflage unless rice plants and wasps evolve ways to elude this mechanism. Unfortunately, waiting for rice plants to evolve a response would entail several generations of reduced rice yield â a disaster for our food supply. An alternative may be to artificially select plants with an advantage in this evolutionary armsÂ race. Doing so will first require dissecting exactly how the planthopperâs olfactory camouflage works, and better understanding how plant odors direct interactions between species."
