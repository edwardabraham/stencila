TeX math blocks are paragraphs starting and ending with `$$` (no blank lines between them). e.g.

$$
2 \pi r^2
$$

Alternatively, code blocks with one of `asciimath`, `latex`, or `tex` as the language are interpreted as math blocks. e.g.

AsciiMath:

```asciimath
2 pi r^2
```

TeX:

```tex
2 \pi r^2
```
