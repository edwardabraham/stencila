A [styled span]{text-green-600} within inline content and [containing **inline** content]{text-blue-600}.

Spans can also be styled using Tailwind classes generated by [code expressions]`"-".join(["text","orange","700"])`{python}.

For consistency, a Tailwind expression can also be in backticks [like this]`text-orange-800`.
