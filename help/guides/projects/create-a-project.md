Once you're [set up](guides/accounts/getting-started.md) as a Stencila account user decide whether you want to create a project under your personal account or [under your organization](guides/organizations/create-an-organization.md). The advance of creating an organization is so that a collection of users can be associated with it and work collaboratively on projects.

## Create a project

Navigate to **projects** on the top header bar.

Choose the account which the project will be owned by.

Create a **project name**. All lower case and unique for your account. Note it will be used in the URLs. e.g. https://hub.stenci.la/awesome-org/great-project

Your project will automatically be **public** which means any Stencila users can view it. Click if you want your project to be **private**.

As the creator of the project you automatically become the project **owner**. This gives you full authority to make changes or delete the project.

You're now set up üëè and ready to [manage your project sources](./manage-project-sources.md). Before you do we highly recommend you finalise your [project settings](./project-settings.md) and chose your theme. It won't take a moment ‚ö°
