The easiest way to install the Stencila CLI on Mac or Linux is to run the install script:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stencila/stencila/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you are on Windows, or would prefer to install manually, see https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/master/cli#-install.

To check that the CLI was installed:

```bash pause=2
stencila --version
```

Success! Now you have the CLI installed, why not check out the other demos on what you can use it for.
