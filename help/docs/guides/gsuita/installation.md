Stencila for Google Docs enables you to execute and embed reproducible figures inside Google Docs.

## Installation

You will be presented with several dialogue windows asking permission for us to work with your documents in Google Drive.

Outlined below are the permissions we ask for, and the explanations for why they are needed.
We strive to request the least amount of permissions needed while still being able to provide
a feature rich add-on. If you notice areas for improvement, please let us know.
