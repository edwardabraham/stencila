Answers to frequently asked questions users have.

## Privacy

Q - If you make your project private can anyone within your organization still view it?

A - Organisation owners and managers by default get manager and owner roles on all projects within that organization. Other members of your organization do not automatically get access to your private project.
You can invite someone to [collaborate on your project](../guides/projects/collaborate-on-a-project.md).
Alternatively you can [share a published project](../guides/projects/share-a-project.md) with anyone. They will be able to read it and execute code chunks but they won't be able to modify the project.

## Publish a project

Q - How do I download a copy of my entire project to create an editable manuscript?

A - You can download a **Snapshot** of your entire project. View [how to publish a project](../guides/projects/publish-a-project.md).
