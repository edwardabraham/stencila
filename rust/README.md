# Stencila Rust

**Core Stencila functionality implemented in a fast, memory-safe language**

## ü¶Ä Introduction

This is the `stencila` Rust library. Its main purpose is to implement core functionality that can be reused in the Stencila [CLI](../cli) and [Desktop](../desktop). There are also bindings to this library for other languages:

- [Node.js](../node) (upon which the Desktop is built)
- [Python](../python) (_experimental_)
- [R](../r) (_experimental_)

## üì¶ Install

You'll need to have [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs) first.

This library is not yet published as a Rust crate, but you can still add it to your `Cargo.toml` using,

```toml
stencila = { git = "https://github.com/stencila/stencila" }
```

## üöÄ Use

Open up the docs to see what's available (including re-exports),

```bash
cargo docs --open --package stencila
```

Then, use what you need :) e.g.

```rust
use stencila::{config, serve, tracing};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Develop

### Getting started

Get started by cloning this repository and [installing Rust](https://rustup.rs) and necessaryCargo plugins (for linting, code coverage etc):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stencila/stencila
cd stencila/rust
make setup
```

If you are contributing code please run formatting, linting and tests before submitting PRs:

```sh
make fix test
```

To reduce compile times, we recommend using [`sccache`](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache), e.g

```sh
cargo install sccache
export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache
```

### Testing

#### Running unit tests

Consistent with Rust conventions, most modules define unit tests withing the modules themselves. You can run unit tests for specific modules by supply a module pattern e.g

```sh
cargo test encode::html
```

#### Running integration tests

There are integration tests, mostly using generative testing approaches, in the `tests` directory. You can run those individually like this:

```sh
cargo test --test patches
```

#### Using feature flags when testing

We make extensive use of Rust feature flags. The main benefit of this is reduced compile times during development. To take advantage of this use the Cargo options `--no-default-features` (to turn off all the default features) and `--features` (to turn on the features that you are currently working on).

For example, if you are working on the compilation of R code chunks, instead of compiling and running the relevant using tests like this:

```sh
cargo test compile::code::r
```

You should get faster compile times using this:

```sh
cargo test --no-default-features --features=compile-r compile::code::r
```

This approach is particularly useful when using `cargo watch`, for example to run the encode-decode ("ende") roundtrip integration test for HTML only when any source file changes:

```sh
cargo watch -x "test --no-default-features --features encode-html,decode-html --test ende html"
```

### Benchmarking

Run benchmarks using,

```sh
cargo bench
```

### Browser assets

In addition to serving documents, WebSocket and REST endpoints, the server also serves static JavaScript, CSS and other browser assets.

The [`stencila/static`](stencila/static) folder contains the symlinks `themes`, `web` and `components`. These symlinks point to folders within `stencila/node_modules` which contain the built assets.

For `components`, the version number is defined in `stencila/package.json`. For `themes` and `web` we currently use `file:` links to sibling folders in this repo. This is useful during development because it allows for on-the-fly rebuilds and hot module reloading.

For the binary builds we embed *everything* that is in `stencila/static` into the binary.


### Language queries

When developing `tree-sitter` language queries for the `methods::compile::code` module, the `tree-sitter` CLI is very useful.

1. Install and setup `tree-sitter` (this is a [good guide](https://dcreager.net/tree-sitter/getting-started/) to that.)

2. Parse fixture files to glean the structure of the AST for the language e.g.

   ```sh
   tree-sitter parse ../fixtures/fragments/r/imports.R
   ```

3. Create a query (or part of a larger query) and test it against the query files e.g.

   ```sh
   tree-sitter query query.txt ../fixtures/fragments/r/imports.R
   ```
