As with many software projects, Stencila has evolved a lot as we have learned what works, and what doesn't. Some older branches have been preserved in this repo, mainly for historical interest.

#### [`triassic`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/triassic) branch c. 2012-2013. 305 commits

Initial explorations and experiments. This branch, introduces `Stencils` (what we now call `Documents`) as data-driven, programmable documents. Stencils are HTML documents containing directives such as `script` (for executing code) and `text` (for evaluating expressions and rendering them as text) encoded as element attributes e.g. `<span data-text="6*7">42</span>`. A mark up language called _Stem_ (later renamed to _Cila_) was developed as an alternative to HTML for authoring. Stem attempts to take the combine the simplicity of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with the flexibility of web templating languages like [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/). In addition, this branch includes work on abstractions for data tables and queries on them (like in [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) and [blaze](http://blaze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)). The implementation strategy in this branch (and the next) was to develop mostly in C++ (making the most of libraries such as [pugixml](http://pugixml.org/) and [tidy-html5](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5)) and then expose this functionality using thin wrappers in host languages, initially R and Python. This branch also includes some initial work on browser-based user interfaces.

#### [`jurassic`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/jurassic) branch c. 2014-2016. 2414 commits

This branch started as a fresh slate to remove the experiments, cleanup the implementation and focus on `Stencils` as the central part of the platform. This branch also marks the start of [releases for this repository](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases). Releases 0.1 to 0.4 really just set things up. Execution contexts for rendering stencils in R and Python were introduced in [0.5](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/tag/0.5) and _Stem_ was re-released as _Cila_ in [0.6](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/tag/0.6). Releases 0.7 to 0.18 were mostly incremental improvements (although together they add up to big improvements in reliability and usability!). Release [0.19](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/tag/0.19) was an important because it was the first to use [Substance](http://substance.io) and was thus a big step up for our browser-based [user interfaces](https://twitter.com/_substance/status/661440688211501056). We went on to leverage Substance and the execution contexts we had already developed to introduce [`Sheets`](https://stenci.la/stencila/blog/introducing-sheets/) in [0.21](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/tag/0.21). Subsequent releases focused on interoperability including introducing a Node.js package in [0.23](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/tag/0.23) and RMarkdown support for stencils in [0.24](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases/tag/0.24).

#### [`cretaceous`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/tree/cretaceous) branch c. 2016-2019. 2360 commits

The implementation strategy we had been using (core in C++ with wrappers for various languages) had advantages (a single fast implementation deployed to various languages) but a few significant problems. Prime amongst these problems was that it was difficult for others to contribute code, particularly those who specialized in a single higher level language e.g R. To address these issues, the strategy is this branch was to use a decoupled, modular architecture with various packages linked via network communications rather than an underlying C++ core. This also opened up some exciting possibilities for distributed and polyglot computing.
