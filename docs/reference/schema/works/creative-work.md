# Creative Work

**A creative work, including books, movies, photographs, software programs, etc.**

This is an implementation, and extension, of schema.org [`CreativeWork`](https://schema.org/CreativeWork).
It extends schema.org `CreativeWork` by, adding several properties including `dateAccepted`
and `fundedBy`.


**`@id`**: [`schema:CreativeWork`](https://schema.org/CreativeWork)

## Properties

The `CreativeWork` type has these properties:
