# Stencila for Node.js

This is a very preliminary version of a `stencila` package for Node.js. It uses [`Neon`](https://neon-bindings.com/) to expose functionality implemented in Rust to Node.js.

This package may be used as the basis of a desktop application using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). See this repository's roadmap for when further work on this package is anticipated.
